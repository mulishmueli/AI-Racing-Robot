This robot is an autonomous small scale racing car using NVIDIA Jetson Nano. 
This project utilizes deep learning neural network framework Keras/Tensorflow, together with computer vision library OpenCV, to achieve self driving. 
The robot has camera and he is using computer vision to detect the road and follow it. 
The robot also can be controled by joystick or cellphone for driving.
